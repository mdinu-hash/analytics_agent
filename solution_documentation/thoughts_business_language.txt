Create glossary Key Terms cu nume, ce inseamna, si felul in care query the database.

Solutia actuala: cauti in objects_documentation, dar realitatea este ca in anumite situatii, trebuie aplicate filtre sau transformari aditionale decat 1:1 dupa coloane. 

poate o solutie ar fi RAG ca si pas initial inainte de crearea analytical intention + glosar cu Key Terms. Glosarul sa contina numele termenului, cat si felul in care query the database (informatii pe care tu acum le pui in column_values). Daca termenul nu se gaseste in baza de date, specifici asta, daca termenul e vag iarasi trebuie specificat.  Tind sa adaug aici informatiile de query si nu in coloane, dar ai nevoie de un check sa vezi daca tabelele si coloanele adaugate aici exista in meta data reference table.

Ex: 
- Client(filter on clients, not stakeholders, account party has both), 
- Firm (main firm or entity_flag = true if asks about DBAs (doing business as)
- Entity (entity_flag=false & active records?)
- Affiliate (entity_flag=false & active records)
- Producing advisor (advisor with affiliation credit >= 50000)
- Firm Revenue = Amount of money ($) received by Commonwealth.
- Advisor Payout = % based on the advisor’s production groupp payout schedule tier (should say you don’t have in db, maybe by leaving blank the query requirements field).
- Advisor Revenue = Firm Revenue after it goes through payout. Firm Revenue x Advisor Revenue.
- Advisor Net Revenue = Advisor Revenue after ticket charges and admin fees are deducted.
- Advisor Compensation (?) = [$] Net Revenue after adjustments are deducted.
- Regulatory AUM = assets related to specific business lines. (cfn_ria_regulatory_aum_flag = true)
- Admin Fee AUM = total assets that is used as the basis for calculating the PPS Admin Fee
- Total AUM = value of all holdings and positions with no limiting criteria.

Affiliation Credit = synonym with Firm Revenue?
Is Advisor Compensation the right word?

Create glossary Synonyms.
Solutia actuala: adaugi sinonime la nivel de coloana. dar creaza dificultati in mentinerea documentatiei intr-un model complex, cu multe coloane. And remove synonyms from meta data reference table.
poate o solutie ar fi RAG ca si pas initial inainte de crearea analytical intention, pt. intelegerea termenilor + glosar cu sinonime.

Ex:
- account party - client
- sponsor - custodian
- production - affiliation credit
- total assets - total market value

Related terms.
Vague terms: Termenul se referra la concepte care nu sunt la fel, dar sunt deseori folosite in organizatie vag, si care pot inseamna una sau alta.
Ex: 
advisor compensation (not exists) can mean any of these terms: affiliation credit - advisor revenue - advisor net revenue - advisor deposit
AUM (not exists) can mean Total AUM, Regulatory AUM, Admin Fee AUM. 

Enhance orchestration & agent architecture

The agent should search in these glossaries: Key Terms, Synonyms, Related Terms, Vague Terms at different stages. (determine if the question is ambiguous, creating the analytical intent, generating the answer, adding key assumptions).

Workflows to add:
User asks about term A which is defined in Key Metrics, then the agent will always apply the query logic for term A (filters and transformations) as defined in the glossary. 
User asks about term A, which is synonym to term B. If term A doesn’t exist in db, but term B exists, agent queries for term B.
User asks about term A. Term A is not in database (or not clearly defined), but term A is related to term B, which exists in database. Agent will query for term B, explaining in Key Assumptions the difference between term B and A (what user asked for).
User asks about term A. Term A is not in database (or not clearly defined), but term A is related to term B and C, which both exists in database. Agent will follow-up asking what the user prefers (B or C), explaining the difference between B and C.

Adapt metadata_reference_table

Acele sugestii cu ce filtre sa aplice le pui la nivel de column_values, le-as pune separat intr-un alt loc, gen sql query considerations or requirements. Take out synonyms & column_values (just the info about querying data).
